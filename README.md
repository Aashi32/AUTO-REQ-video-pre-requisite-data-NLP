# AUTO-REQ-video-pre-requisite-data-NLP

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the AUTO-REQ-video-pre-requisite-data project, which is focused on identifying pre-requisites between academic videos to enhance the learning experience on online platforms. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze the video transcripts.

## Notebook
The main notebook for this project is located on Google Colab. You can access it "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_D00OOSqpFrAKUIXPr4DHSEu_x0NuCzl?usp=sharing".

## Preprocessing Techniques Used
The following preprocessing techniques were used on the video transcripts:

-> Cleaning: Removal of symbols, special characters, and numbers.
-> Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.
-> Stopword Removal: Removal of common words that do not contribute to the meaning of the text.
-> Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or root form.

## Usage
To run the notebook, open it in Google Colab and follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Note
This project does not require any specific environment setup or dependencies beyond the libraries imported in the notebook itself.
If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
